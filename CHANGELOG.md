## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-07

### ðŸŽ‰ Production-Ready Release

Complete rewrite with robust error handling, security hardening, and performance optimization.

### Added
- **Multi-file support**: Upload multiple files via glob patterns (e.g., `dist/*.zip`) or newline-separated lists
- **MD5 deduplication**: Automatically skip uploads when file content is identical (MD5 match)
- **Update-in-place**: Preserve permissions and links by updating existing files instead of delete+create
- **Link discoverability control**: New `link_discoverable` input for "anyone with link" vs searchable files
- **Enhanced outputs**: Added `updated` and `skipped` boolean outputs for workflow logic
- **Dependency validation**: Fail-fast checks for required tools (jq, curl, openssl, file)
- **Folder preflight check**: Validate folder exists and is accessible before upload
- **Security hardening**:
  - Token masking with `::add-mask::` to prevent leaks in logs
  - All JSON built with jq (no injection risks)
  - Proper credential cleanup with `unset` at script end
- **Retry logic**: Automatic retries (5x) with exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Timeout protection**: 300s max per request to prevent hanging jobs

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Default `sharing` changed from `anyone` to `none` (principle of least privilege)
- **BREAKING**: `direct_link` now returns canonical Drive URL instead of brittle confirm bypass
- **Improved search**: Query by parent folder only, then filter locally (no quote injection)
- **Better JWT signing**: Use `printf` instead of `echo -n` for portability
- **Enhanced MIME detection**: Fallback to `application/octet-stream` on failure
- **Canonical link fetching**: Get `webViewLink` and `webContentLink` directly from API
- **Resumable upload headers**: Include `X-Upload-Content-Type` and `X-Upload-Content-Length`
- **Better duplicate handling**: Delete all duplicates or use existing based on overwrite setting

### Fixed
- **Quote injection vulnerability**: Filenames with special characters no longer break searches
- **Race conditions**: Update-in-place prevents permission loss during overwrites
- **Session URL extraction**: More robust Location header parsing
- **curl error handling**: Now uses `-fsS` to fail on HTTP errors properly
- **Remote MD5 handling**: Proper empty string handling when MD5 unavailable

### Security
- âœ… No JSON injection vulnerabilities (all via jq)
- âœ… Proper token masking in logs
- âœ… Credential cleanup on exit
- âœ… Safe glob expansion with proper nullglob handling
- âœ… Input validation for all parameters

### Performance
- ðŸš€ MD5 skip saves bandwidth on unchanged files
- ðŸš€ Update-in-place preserves links and permissions
- ðŸš€ Batch permission operations
- ðŸš€ Efficient multi-file processing
